## 🌍 About This Project

The **Ultimate WARP Generator** is a powerful, web-based tool designed to provide a seamless experience for creating, managing, and sharing custom **Cloudflare WARP** configurations. My mission is to empower users to easily bypass censorship and access a secure, private, and unrestricted internet.

This generator automates the entire process of creating a WARP account and exporting the configuration into multiple formats, saving you from complex manual steps. Whether you need a simple **WireGuard config** or an advanced setup for **Sing-Box**, this tool has you covered.

## ✨ Key Features

This generator is packed with features to give you full control over your free VPN configurations:

* **🚀 Instant WARP Account Generation:** Create new, private Cloudflare WARP accounts with a single click. No registration required.

* **📁 Multi-Format Config Export:** Get your free WARP config in multiple popular formats:
    * **Standard WireGuard:** For universal compatibility with the official WireGuard clients on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS).
    * **AmneziaWG:** Includes pre-configured Jitter settings for enhanced stability and performance on restricted or high-latency networks.
    * **Sing-Box:** A complete JSON configuration with **URL-Test** enabled to automatically select the fastest, lowest-latency endpoint for optimal speed.

    * Save multiple WARP accounts with custom names.
    * Easily switch between, rename, or delete saved configurations.

* **🔄 Automatic Endpoint Updates:** Fetch the latest list of working Cloudflare endpoints at any time to ensure your connection is always fast and reliable.
